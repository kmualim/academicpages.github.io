# Early Projects 

## How to get into coding? 

I started my adventure by coding simple algorithms to solve a bunch of fun and quirky questions! 
These were the very first codes I did, ever. 

The project includes solving questions via programming: 

1. What are the number of coins required to make change? 
2. Which years are considered leap years? 

and to make things more relevant to our scientists out there, 

3. What is the Watson Crick Complement of DNA strands?
