title : "Tantalizing tastes!"
excerpt : " Our understanding of taste is as scarce as the brain. I believe that in a lot of ways, food is a language that can be understood globally and has to be deconstructed via posessing a greater understanding of our neuronal networks. <br>
In summary, this project branches into discovering how our tastes and preferences generate neuronal spike information.

## The Idea

If you'd like just a quick background in tastes, Check out my video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AujY-Fkx5z8&feature=youtu.be).

Now that we're all up to speed with our taste buds,

In the fundamental stages of its development, the idea constitutes the use of an EEG machine and a variety of personalized taste tests. The ability for us to taste (salty, sweet, bitter, umami and sourness) brings about spike information that have overlaps. 

## The Approach

While usual experiments are geared towards treating taste as a universal entity, I plan to take a different approach. Our taste and preferences direct the firing properties of our "taste" neurons and are fundamentally responsible in determining our likes and dislikes in terms of food, clearly illustrating how unique our tastes become through development.
