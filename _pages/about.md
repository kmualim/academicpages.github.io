# About Me

A driven and dedicated biochemist turned software engineer, interested in the applications of tech to answering biological questions. 

I love exploring and continuously searching for new diverse projects. While I enjoy building and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, I love to hike, meet new people and [reinvent the ways we enjoy and consume food](https://kristy-mualim.squarespace.com).

Check out my [projects here](https://kmualim.github.io/publications/) & my [cv](https://kmualim.github.io/cv).
