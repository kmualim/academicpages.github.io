# About Me 

I'm currently working in a Structural Biochemistry Lab that uses Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to analyze protein and nucleic acid structures particularly proteins relating to Parkinsonsâ€™ Disease (PD). One of the earliest implications of PD is the loss of olfactory and gustatory senses which sparked interest in a novel project relating to neural networks and taste and preferences. 

I'm a Third Year Biochemistry Undergraduate, minoring in Computer Science. I'm trained in structural biological techniques but am branching into the field of Programming. My interests lie in the interdisciplinary applications of Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning and my passion only drives learning at an exponential rate. 
I'm incredibly fascinated with neural networks and wish to work towards demystifying our neural networks and the connectome. 

I believe that Machine Learning is being its effect on revolutionizing the way we do things - even in ways we have yet to discover.
