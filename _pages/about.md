A driven and dedicated biochemist turned software engineer, interested in the applications of tech to answering biological questions.  

I love exploring and continuously searching for new diverse projects. While I enjoy building and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, I love to hike, bake and meet new people!

Check out my [past projects here](https://kmualim.github.io/publications/) & my [cv](https://kmualim.github.io/cv).
