# About Me 

I'm a recent graduate from McGill University, recently moved to San Francisco, California. 

I'm a machine learning engineer, interested in its application in Biology. 

I'm currently working in a Structural Lab that uses Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to analyze protein and nucleic acid structures particularly proteins relating to Parkinsonsâ€™ Disease (PD). One of the earliest implications of PD is the loss of olfactory and gustatory senses which sparked an interest in a novel project relating to neural networks & taste and preference. [Learn more about it here](https://kmualim.github.io/portfolio/tantalizingtaste/). I believe that Machine Learning has the ability to revolutionize the way we do things - even in ways we have yet to discover.
