## About Me

A driven and curious biochemist turned software engineer, interested in the applications of technology in answering biological questions

I love exploring and engaging in different new diverse projects. While I enjoy building machine learning models, I also love to hike, meet new people and [reinvent the ways we enjoy and consume food](https://kristy-mualim.squarespace.com).

Check out my [projects here](https://kmualim.github.io/publications/) & my [cv](/files/cv.pdf).
