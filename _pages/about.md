# About Me 

I'm incredibly enthralled in deciphering the connectome and seek to explore new algorithms that would help demystify the functionalities of our neural networks. My interests lie in the interdisciplinary applications of Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning that could help better the world. 
With its boundless benefits, bridging the technological gap within cities and states may seek to provide opportunities for a wider proportion of the population. 
In addition, advancing methods of detection in diseases and mental health that aim to redistribute knowledge to areas where healthcare is limited to the privilege. 

I'm currently working in a Structural Lab that uses Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to analyze protein and nucleic acid structures particularly proteins relating to Parkinsonsâ€™ Disease (PD). One of the earliest implications of PD is the loss of olfactory and gustatory senses which sparked an interest in a novel project relating to neural networks & taste and preference. [Learn more about it here](https://kmualim.github.io/portfolio/tantalizingtaste/). I believe that Machine Learning has the ability to revolutionize the way we do things - even in ways we have yet to discover.
