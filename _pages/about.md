# About Me 
======
I'm a Third Year Biochemistry Undergraduate, minoring in Computer Science. I'm trained in structural biological techniques but am branching into the field of Programming. My interests lie in the interdisciplinary applications of Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning and my passion only drives learning at an exponential rate. 
I'm incredibly fascinated with neural networks and wish to work towards demystifying our neural networks and the connectome. 

I believe that Machine Learning is being its effect on revolutionizing the way we do things - even in ways we have yet to discover.
