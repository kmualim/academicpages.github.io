# Connect 4

I loved playing this game as a child and I welcome you to play it too!

# BlackJack

BlackJack became one of the only card games I really learnt to play. I mean, I suppose it doesn't really take much but still! 
The game plays as [follows](https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html). 

& uses CardPileforBlackJack.java and BlackJack.java files to play found [here](https://github.com/kmualim/Create-games).

# Card Game 

If you're down for a BlackJack game, I invite you to play a really simple card game. 
Cards are “dealt” out, one at a time,so that each player gets roughly the same number of Cards. It is possible at the end that some players will have one extra card.
(For example, if there are 52 cards and 5 players, then some players will have 10 cards and others 11
cards.)
The winner of the game is the player with the Ace of Spades.

& uses CardPile.java, CardGame.java and Card.java to play found [here](https://github.com/kmualim/Create-games). 

# Sudoku 

If all those games weren't tickling your fancy then let's play Sudoku. My mother loved this game and she loves playing this version of Sudoku. 
The rules of the game are as [follows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku). 

& uses Sudoku.java to play found [here](https://github.com/kmualim/Create-games). 

I hope you've enjoyed all the games!
