# Classification task

By using sklearn/tensorflow/pytorch libraries, we generated a classifier that could classify hand-drawn images from Google's *Quick, Draw!* project. 
The dataseet contained images that were not always centerred and straight, or free of noisy artifacts. In addition, the classifierrr needed to identify 
empty pictures as well.
