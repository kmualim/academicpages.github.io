# My Projects

Later, I took to implementing the various data structures present in Java to implement classification systems as well as an API Connect 4 game. 
My projects utilize various data structures to create and implement classification systems in a given Warehouse (#Sorting Warehouses) and sorts buildings based on a specific characteristic about these buildings (#Building Classification) , such as Year Of Construction. 

# Sorting Warehouses 

##  Automating a Warehouse

Automation is used in a lot of places like Amazon, allowing massive distribution of packages leading to an industrial revolution. This project seeks to implement the same structure surrounding automation in these massive companies. 
I've used the implementation of linked lists to create a sorting and classification system that would categorize boxes based on their height, shelf space and urgency, seen in this

# Building Classficiation

## How are Binary Search Trees relevant to any of us? 

The idea was to be able to use Binary Search Trees in figuring out how to classify things in the office - Managing Buildings for Renovation 
Alternatively, through the implementation of tree structures, a separate project shows its implementation in categorizing objects. I took this to categorize various buildings based on their year of construction, height, year of repair and cost of repair. All these attributes help in figuring out specific values relative to the action one wishes to take.
